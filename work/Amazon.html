          The above artifact is part of a self review I did at the end of my internship with Amazon.

        <p>
          Out of all the work experiences I have had during my college career, I can definitely say that I enjoyed this
          one the most. I connected really well with the team and felt as though I learned a lot both technically, and also
          how to communicate well with others. I felt both pushed and supported at the same time. I think that if I can
          continue to get myself to work environments such as the one I had at Amazon, I will be able to make my career both
          fun and engaging.
