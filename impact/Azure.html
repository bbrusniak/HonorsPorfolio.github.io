        <p>
          Over the course of this past quarter, I think that I was able to achieve many of the goals that I hoped
          to achieve as a project manager. I was able to handle the logistics of setting up team meetings, connecting with
          our Microsoft mentors, etc., and I think that I was able to provide a consistent place where the developers
          felt comfortable working. I was also able to meet and talk with each of my developers one on one to
          discuss how they felt the project was going on a regular basis. Additionally, I was able to support the
          developers in various ways whether it be through helping debug a particularly difficult issue, providing
          direction on what work they should tackle next, or advising them when they felt uncertain or not confident
          in their contributions. I was also able to do technical work as well, and so I was able to learn more about
          JavaScript and TypeScript, as well as improve other general technical skills such as using Git and Github.
          In this way, I think that I was able to grow as a leader and as a technical advisor, and thus accomplished
          what I wanted to get out of this experience. In terms of impact, our team authored 27 pull requests and
          resolved 7 issues on the repository. This means that our team created 27 different sections of code changes
          that were merged into the code base and resolved 7 issues as outline by the Azure-JS-SDK team. These
          changes are now live and affect anyone developing code for the Azure-JS-SDK repository.
