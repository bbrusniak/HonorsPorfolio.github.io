          The artifact above is the final project my group created for Data Visualization
          (see <a href="https://cse442-21f.github.io/FP-Phys-ualization/">website</a>).

          This course and project really helped me see the benefit of having people with different areas of
          expertise. This elective was completely project based, with the majority of the work being done in
          groups. One of the moments that I can distinctly remember the most was how I did not know how to process
          large amounts of data in CSV format, and one of my group members wrote a solution in two lines using a python
          tool I was not familiar with. Meanwhile, I had a lot of NodeJS experience and was able to heavily contribute with
          the infrastructure of the project. This was a great learning experience for me, as I felt that the work I did
          on that team was a great example of Adam Smith and the division of labor :)
