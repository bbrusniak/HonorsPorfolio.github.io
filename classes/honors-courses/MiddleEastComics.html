          The above artifact is a comic I drew for the class depicting some of the scenes from <em>The Book of Devices</em> by Ihsan Oktay Anar.

          My biggest takeaway from this course is the idea that any kind of work can be deconstructed into the greater context from which
          it came whether that be historical, political, sociological, etc. The clearest example I remember on this subject was the
          discussion of Orientalism. It really opened my eyes to the fact that a story, movie, or piece of art that may seem to be just
          for entertainment can have a larger narrative behind it. As someone who is going into the technology industry, I think I have
          often taken this naïve view of thinking that since I am just building a tool for others to use, I do not have to necessarily
          consider some of the larger ramifications of what I am making. However, it is clear to me now that this is not an option.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going forward, I hope to continue with this mindset of looking to larger contexts regardless of what class I am in. The most
          impactful reading for me for this deconstruction would have to be Berger, and also some of the ideas from Barthes. Additionally,
          in terms of pure enjoyment I loved how McCloud took an analytical approach to comics, a topic that is often dismissed as less
          intellectual, and gives the reader a way to approach them from a more academic standpoint.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, however, I think what I will remember most from the course and what comes first to my mind when I hear the Near/Middle
          East Illustrated was the poem “Necati” that we would often illustrate different parts of at the beginning of class. It was so
          much fun to try and draw the different scenes and to get to share them with classmates. The other aspect of class I think of
          most when I hear about the Near/Middle East Illustrated is Persepolis. The story is just such an incredibly humanizing one, and
          was the first work we read where I started to think a lot more about how little I knew about all the diverse perspectives held in
          the region.
