          The above artifact is a picture of Professor Reges performing a mathematical card trick for us during the CSE 143 honors seminar.

          In order to make CSE 143 an honors class, I am taking an additional one credit honors seminar. The class is incredibly interesting
          in that we talk about a lot of really meta, conceptual topics, but then Professor Reges also makes sure we talk about something
          factual and STEM related. One of my favorite parts of the class is the mathematical problems Professor Reges poses to us. The one
          pictured above was a magic trick which he challenged us to figure out given a few different examples of the trick. Other mathematical
          concepts we have tackled in the class include Turing machines and creating Rubik's cube algorithms from scratch. Each of his classes
          has been so engaging and I am now considering trying to minor in math in hopes of coming across similarly interesting problems to
          the ones we cover in this honors seminar.
