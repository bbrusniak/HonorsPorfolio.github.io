          During my final reflection assignment I wrote for Honors 230C, I wrote down three major takeaways I had gotten from the class:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            How intertwined history and political narrative can be.
          </li>
          <li>
            How to make historical claims with limited information.
          </li>
          <li>
            How history and historical narrative still have political implications today.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          However, I think such a brief summary would do a disservice to just how much my thinking has changed over the course of this class
          and some of the more eye-opening experiences I had over this quarter. Professor Warren does a great job of structuring the class in
          such a way that we started with the dominant, Western historical narrative of the Aztecs, and then slowly peeled back many of the
          assumptions I had been unknowingly making about that history, and about the power of history in general. The two most striking of
          these moments I can remember was reading some of the final chapters of Matthew Restallâ€™s When Montezuma Met Cortes, as well as our
          class trip to the Burke museum.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think at its core, one of the most important strategies to learning this class taught me was to always be thinking about why
          certain stories can be so appealing. Almost any grand narrative that is well known is going to some extent be over simplified,
          and it is up to us as scholars, and more generally, good citizens, to do our best to try and understand what those assumptions
          or left-out information are. Although I am not currently on the path of pursuing work in the historical field, I still think that
          this mindset will serve me well in trying to understand whether ideas I hear about in the workplace actually have merit, or are
          just part of a good narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I were in the historical field, however, there would be so many different research questions I could pursue. And, since I
          come from a technical background, I think that the combination of these two fields could produce interesting work. One research
          question I was thinking about was trying to create data visualizations for how artifacts have traveled around the world. Towards
          the end of class, there was much discussion on museums as places of power, and I think a technical visualization like this could
          demonstrate that, as well as provide a voice for the places from which those artifacts came. Another interesting research question
          in the combination of these two fields I would consider pursuing is the tracing of these historical narratives over time. I think
          it would be really cool to try and work with natural language processing (NLP) models to try and somehow show how these stories
          coming from limited source grow and spread over time. Finally, as I stated in my final project for this course, another purely
          historical research topic I would consider pursuing is how the Spanish changed the structure of government for the natives living
          in the Central Valley of Mexico.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, it has been a rather long time since I have taken a class with a focus on history, but I am very glad that I took this
          one. It was a fair bit of reading and writing, but in the end I have found myself with a new perspective on how to approach history,
          and a greater understanding of the absolutely fascinating societies in and around the Central Valley of Mexico.
