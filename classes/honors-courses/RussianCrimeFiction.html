          The above artifact is the final paper I wrote for my Russian Crime Fiction course.
        </p>

          What this artifact represents to me is my continued interest in literature. Although I have been taking a lot of
          technical courses and extra curriculars, I have always been fascinated by reading. Additionally, I think that there
          is something inherently human about trying to manifest one's thoughts through essays or discussions, and this was a
          class in which I felt I was able to continue to develop those skills. Professor Galya Diment did a great job of facilitating
          an intellectually engaging environment, despite the fact that this course was online. I especially loved the format she
          gave for the midterm and final, as her questions left room for a lot of creative expression. I am especially proud of the final
          that is pictured above, as I thought that I was able to communicate fairly complex ideas in an interesting yet digestable way.
