          Over the course of the past two quarters, being a research assistant has taught me a lot. I think one of the major things I
          have gotten out of this experience is how to try and work with more open ended questions and requirements, an experience which
          I don't get as much in my classes where assignments and outcomes tend to be more well defined. For example, from the technical
          side, working with Nigini I have learned a lot on how to communicate what my code can and cannot do, as well as communicate how
          I think it is best to move forward when designing different aspects of the project such as how our design interventions look or
          what data should be collected. These topics, technical limitations, data collection, and intervention design, are new to me and
          deal with this idea of taking an abstract idea - our research question of if we can create designs which will make users from a
          collectivist background feel more included when using StackOverflow Q&A pages - and turning them into implementations and results.
          On the less technical side, I have also been attending lab meetings and reading some papers and so it has also been a great learning
          experience for me to see how other researchers narrow down and define open ended questions they would like to explore. Additionally,
          I have been helping with recruiting study participants this quarter, and this was also quite the open-ended challenge, as there was
          not a set way in which we were supposed to recruit. And so, I worked on a strategy with Nigini on how we would recruit participants,
          and we implemented that strategy by emailing professors, posting to discussion boards, changing participation incentives, etc., and
          we were able to successfully recruit many new participants.

          However, reflecting on my overall research experience, it did not end up being all successful. I never fully engaged in the paper
          writing process, and so I did not have the opportunity to publish a paper. Furthermore, I think that one of the big takeaways I had
          from this experience was that I felt as though I needed to see a more immediate impact from my work. A lot of the premises and impact
          that could have come out of my work felt very abstract and theoretical. That does not mean, however, that I could never see myself
          pursuing research. I think that I just need to gain more life experience, and if I run into problems that I think are worth pursuing
          from an abstract level, those life experiences could ground and materialize the research enough for me to see myself solving those problems
          from the more removed level of research.
