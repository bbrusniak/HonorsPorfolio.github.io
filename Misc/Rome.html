        This quarter I did an early fall start class where I traveled to Rome for two weeks. I would normally
        not have pegged myself as someone who would study abroad, but I wanted to do something different after
        I graduated high school. I am so thankful that I went on the trip. Flying halfway around the world,
        meeting a completely new set of people, and successfully caring for myself for two weeks in a foreign
        country gave me a big confidence boost that I needed before college. After the trip I felt that living
        independently from parents was not such a big deal. Additionally, I feel that I have continued to carry
        a more spontaneous mindset and a willingness to try new things into my first quarter as a freshman.
