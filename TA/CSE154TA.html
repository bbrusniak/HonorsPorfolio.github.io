          Being a teaching assistant for CSE 154 (Web Programming) is what has really solidified my
          love of being a teaching assistant. I get to spend a large chunk of my TA devoted hours to
          office hours and section (because there are two sections a week!) and so I get to do even more
          of what I love about being a TA. Not only that, however, I also genuinely love the material and this
          is a very practical class which teaches readily apparent skills like being able to build a full stack
          project from scratch. Being a CSE 154 TA has really been an awesome experience with a cross over of getting to
          do a type of work I enjoy on a subject that I think is relevant and interesting.
