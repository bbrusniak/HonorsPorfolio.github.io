      <p>
        Ever since I realized that students could be TAs, I decided that I would like to be one. I had an awesome intro CSE 143 TA who was both very
        kind and knowledgeable. And so, when I finally had the opportunity to TA, I jumped at it. This artifact is my "graduation" certifcate from
        14x TA training, a one credit course that intro CS TAs are required to take the first quarter that they are a TA.

        I would say that one of the major takeaways that I got from this experience was figuring out what I did and did not like about teaching. With this quarter
        being online as well, I feel as though the difference between these two categories was quite delineated. I found that I really enjoyed prepping and teaching
        section, as well as holding my office hours. And, I realized what I despised most about teaching was ~grading~ However, the pros definitely
        outweighed the cons. And so, despite the VERY significant time commitment (~20hrs/week), this experience left me with the impression that I wanted to teach
        again, but make sure I do it in a quarter in which I have a lighter workload.
